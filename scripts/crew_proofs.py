"""One command that runs every crew proof and says which one broke.

The proofs are the plugin's own acceptance evidence, but nothing ran them together: a regression sat
in a proof that nobody executed until the owner hit it in chat. This runner is that one command - it
discovers every proof beside it, runs each in its own process, keeps the tail of its output, and
exits non-zero when any of them fails, so a cron job or a git hook can gate on it.

  crew_proofs.py                     every proof, the live-service ones skipped
  crew_proofs.py --all               every proof, including the ones that need a live chat or a desktop
  crew_proofs.py --only heal,unstale run the proofs whose file name matches any of these words
  crew_proofs.py --list              what would run, and what is held back, and why
  crew_proofs.py --json              the same result as data
  crew_proofs.py --timeout 900       per-proof ceiling in seconds (default 600)
  crew_proofs.py --jobs 4            proofs that run at once (default: cores / 2, 2 to 4; 1 = strictly serial)
  crew_proofs.py --changed           proofs touched by the working tree, for a pre-push gate

Exit: 0 when every proof that ran passed, 1 when one failed, 2 when the runner itself could not run.

Every proof runs on the kernel's `crew-proofs` board, never the live one: the runner creates the board
(`hermes kanban boards create crew-proofs`, idempotent) and gives every child the env that pins it
(crew_proof_board.proofs_env). A proof that seeds cards calls crew_proof_board.require_proof_board first
and exits 2 when it would write to the live default board.

Parallel run: only the proofs in ISOLATED run beside each other and beside the rest. Each of them builds a
scratch board, a scratch HERMES_HOME and its own temp dir (or only reads), so they share nothing. Every other
proof seeds or reads the shared `crew-proofs` board, or drives a Chrome on a fixed port, so those run one after
another in a single lane (a proof not listed in ISOLATED is in that lane: a new proof is serial until it is
shown to be independent). The result of every proof is the same serial or parallel; only the wall time differs.

Live-service proofs are held back by default: they send a real message or drive the desktop
panel, so they need a reachable server and they leave traces. They run with --all, and they are named
in --list as skipped, never silently dropped.
